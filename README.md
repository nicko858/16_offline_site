By default, bootstap templates doesn't work without the Internet connection. Using this template, you can code HTML offline.
All the dependencies transfered  to the code repository.

# How to Install

cd <your_path>
git clone https://github.com/nicko858/16_offline_site

# How to use
By default, the html-template uses relative paths for the dependencies: 
```html
<link href="/static/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
You may leave this option by default, or use absolute paths.
